# Plan 

Write a brief overview here that prompts myself to create jupyter notebooks for each section. Possibly all in one notebook.


# Introduction to Python

could just use what George wrote and add some bits I want to say 

# Structure of a Python file 

possibly a bit odd to do in a notebook but worth mentioning the #!/bin/bash  and importing packages.

# Data Types 

ez.

# Functions

basics here, mention that you can/should use a separate file of functions, comment them and keep them generic so that you can use them in as many different applications as possible. 

# Packages you'll use all the time.

matplotlib numpy scipy pandas 


# Debugging
