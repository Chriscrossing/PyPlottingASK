    "also a fan of the BBC's rather silly TV programme Monty Python's Flying Circus. It is one the most\n",
    "popular coding languages in the world and has wide-ranging applications from data science to\n",
    "web frameworks. Because of its popularity many, many third party packages exist, this includes plotting and mathematics, but also more obscure areas like laboratory instrument control and many different GUI interfaces.\n",

    "I'm going to be writing this tutorial in Jupyter Notebook form, with documentation written in markdown code, as is how the text that you're reading right now is formatted. However, please do not feel you also have to use Jupyter notebook! There are many other methods that you may find easier, such as the Spyder IDE or even a text editor and running the python code using a terminal. Feel free to copy and paste code blocks into whatever application you are using to run python. Just be aware that Jupyter notebook maintains variables between code blocks and I won't always be repeating variable assignments as we go along. So if yo get an error running this code in something else, unassigned variable should be your first item to check. \n",

    "Though you can't trust every site that pops up on google, some good places to start are: \n",

    "1) in any python terminal you can use the function `help()` on any function to get a print out of a brief manual\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, this means that when you run a python file that the python software converts the files contents on the fly into machine code that your computers processor can understand. The alternative would be a coding language where the code has to be compiled into another file format before it is ran by your cpu, an example of this is c++. Python is also a relatively high level language, this means that the majority of the code is abstracted into easy to use functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run simple operations in a linear fassion such as using python as a calculator you may simply open up a python terminal window. Try this out! \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Open up Anaconda and then the Spyder app.\\\n",
    "2) The bottom right window in Spyder is the IPython console! \\\n",
    "3) In the IPython console you may type out python code one line at a time; \n",
    "\n",
    ">```python \n",
    ">In [1] 1+2 \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Out[1] 3 \n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may even import a package into the current enviroment and use a function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python \n",
    ">In [2] import numpy as np \n",
    ">\n",
    ">In [3] np.sqrt(2)\n",
    ">Out[3] 1.4142135623730951 \n",
    "\n",
    "We just worked out the square-root of 2, you could in theory write all of your code like this. But then what if you made a mistake, or wanted to run the same code again with a different variable? That would be majorly inconvenient!! \n",
    "\n",
    "So to make coding simpler we can write python scripts and save them for later use, you never know when you'll forget how to square-root a number and will need to look at a previous file for that pesky numpy square-root function!! \n",
    "\n",
    "> Then when you come to finish a script, if you are using spyder, press the green arrow to run that whole file in the terminal window. Or use the keyboard shortcut `F5`. The shortcut to run a code block in jupter notebook is `shift+enter`."

    "\n",
    "Every Python file usually follows a similar structure, it is good to start with a large comment to tell anyone other than the coder what the file does. Next will be where packages are imported into the environment and finally the python code to be executed. Along with clear comments for what is going on in the code. You never know who will need to read your code or if you'll actually remember what's going on in the future. \n",
